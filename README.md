 Conducted multi-model benchmarking (LR, NB, DT, KNN, RF, LightGBM) on 11,031 participants

## Data
The data used in this project are not publicly available due to privacy or size constraints.
Instructions for data access or data format description can be provided upon request.
Exploratory Jupyter notebooks are maintained in a separate branch (`notebooks`)
to keep the main branch clean and reproducible.

## Methods
- Feature extraction
- Model architecture
- Training procedure
- Evaluation metrics

## Models
Trained model files (.joblib) are not included due to size constraints.
Models can be reproduced by running the training scripts.

## Environment
- Python 3.9
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- pytorch

## Notes
This project is NOT under active development.
